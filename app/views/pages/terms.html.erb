    <h2>13. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h2>

    <p>You understand and agree that the Services and all materials and Content available on or through the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis and your access to and use of the Services and Content is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, HashtagLife and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (the “HashtagLife Entities”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FORA PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE HashtagLife ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICES, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, COMPLETE, ACCURATE, AVAILABLE, TIMELY, RELIABLE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>
    <p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE HashtagLife ENTITIES OR THE SERVICEs THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ALL DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICEs, YOUR DEALINGS WITH OTHER USERS, AND ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES.

    <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources which are not under our control and you acknowledge and agree that the HashtagLife Entities do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their content.</p>
    <p>HashtagLife may provide tools through the Services that enable you to export information, including User Content, to third party services, including through features that allow you to link your account on HashtagLife with an account on the third party service, such as Twitter or Facebook, or through our implementation of third party buttons (such as “like” or “share” buttons). By using these tools, you agree that we may transfer such information to the applicable third-party service. Such third party services are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their use of your exported information.</p>
    <p><strong>c. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
    <p>IN NO EVENT WILL THE HashtagLife ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES), WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) STATUTE, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER OR NOT THE HashtagLife ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONTENT POSTED BY A THIRD PARTY OR OTHERWISE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICE; AND (iii) CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTY USERS OF THE SERVICE.</p>

    <p>EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS.</p>
    
        <h2>14.	Indemnity</h2><p>You agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Services, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless HashtagLife and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Services; (ii) your violation of these Terms or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.</p>
        
    <h2>15.	Modifications of these Terms</h2><p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. In the event that a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you will be required to accept such modified terms in order to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon your acceptance of such the modified Terms. Immaterial modifications are effective upon publication. For the avoidance of doubt, disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with these Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.</p>
    
    <h2>16.	Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
    <p><strong>a. Generally.</strong></p>
    <p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and HashtagLife in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and HashtagLife agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND HashtagLife ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
    <p><strong>b. Exceptions.</strong></p>
    <p>Notwithstanding Subsection a, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
</p>
    <p><strong>c. Arbitrator.</strong></p>
    <p>Any arbitration between you and HashtagLife will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting HashtagLife.</p>
    <p><strong>d. Notice; Process.</strong></p>
    <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). HashtagLife’s address for Notice is listed in Section 11. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or HashtagLife may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or HashtagLife shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, HashtagLife shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by HashtagLife in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.
</p>
    <p><strong>e. Fees.</strong></p>
    <p>In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, HashtagLife will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Hillsborough County, Florida, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse HashtagLife for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
    <p><strong>f. No Class Actions.</strong></p>
    <p>YOU AND HashtagLife AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and HashtagLife agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
    <p><strong>g. Modifications.</strong></p>
    <p>In the event that HashtagLife makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to HashtagLife’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to HashtagLife’s address for Notice, in which case your account with HashtagLife shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.</p>
    <p><strong>h. Confidentiality.</strong></p>
    <p>No part of the procedures shall be open to the public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be prevented from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>
    <p><strong>i. Enforceability.</strong></p>
    <p>If Subsection f is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17.d shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
    
    <h2>17.	Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p><strong>a. Waiver</strong></p>
    <p>HashtagLife’s failure to require and enforce your compliance with any provision of these Terms does not affect HashtagLife’s right to require and enforce your compliance with that provision in the future. The failure of HashtagLife to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision and a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p>
    <p><strong>b. Severability</strong></p>
    <p>If a court or other administrative body rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p><strong>c. Governing Law</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    <p><strong>d. Jurisdiction</strong></p>
    <p>To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States to litigate any disputes with HashtagLife related to these Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>e. Entire Agreement</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between HashtagLife and you regarding your use of and access to the Services. Except as expressly provided above, these Terms may only be modified with a written agreement executed by both parties. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions.</p>
    <p><strong>f. Consent to Electronic Communications</strong></p>
    <p>By using the Services, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices. For instance, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communication be in writing.</p><p>
These Services are operated and provided by HashtagLife Inc., Street Adress Tampa, FL 00000. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us. If you are a Florida resident, you may have these Terms mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your electronic mail address and a request for these Terms.
