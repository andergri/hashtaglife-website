These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</li></ul><p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p><ul><li>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use HashtagLife and provide features to you.</li><li>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</li></ul><p><strong>Log file information:</strong></p><ul><li>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</li><li>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
</li></ul><p><strong>Device identifiers:</strong></p><ul><li>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by HashtagLife.</li><li>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li></ul><p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p><ul><li>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</li><li>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</li></ul>   
    
        <p>Our Privac</p>    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>Through the Service, you can secretly share messages, pictures, comments and other content (“Posts”) with certain other users of the Service. When you share a Post through the app, you are secretly sharing your Post with the contacts that you have stored on your mobile device each time you access our Service who also register with our Service (your “Friends”).  In addition, each time a user “loves” a Post, that Post is shared with all the contacts of that user (“Friends of Friends”) and so on.  People who can see your Posts because they have been loved by Friends, Friends of Friends and so on are considered in your “Network.” We may also choose to feature certain Posts, in which case such Posts may be secretly shared with all users of the Service.</p>  <p>For more information about the Service, please see our <a href="/faq">FAQ page</a>.</p> 
    
    
    <h2>Modifications</h2> <p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>  <h2>Collection of Information</h2> <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3> <p>We collect information you directly give us. For example, we collect information about you when you sign up for our Service, make a Post, give feedback about the Service or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your email address, mobile phone number and any other information you choose to provide. When you request the App to find your Friends, we also collect certain information from your contacts on your mobile device, including your contacts’ email addresses and phone numbers, so you can secretly share your Posts with people you know who are already using the App.  However, we hash your contacts email address and phone number before they leave your mobile device so we do not have access to that information.  For information as to how to restrict the collection of contact information, please see the “Your Choices” section below. We may also collect information about you from other users of the Services (for eg. we may collect your contact details from other users if such details are stored on the user's mobile device).  If you choose not to provide certain information, we may not be able to provide the Service to you or certain features of the Service may be unavailable or work differently. </p>  <h3>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Service</h3> <p>When you access or use our Service, we automatically collect information about you.

This means that if a court asks us to disclose your identity, we may be compelled to do so.  If we do happen to receive a subpoena or court order requesting that we disclose your information, we will attempt contact you if reasonably feasible before we disclose any information to give you time to fight the subpoena in court.  In the United States, you may be able to fight the subpoena on the basis that it violates your First Amendment right to speak anonymously.</p>  <p>The only way to make your Posts untraceable is to use our “unlinking” feature, described in more detail below under Your Choices, which eliminates any link between your Post and your account.</p>  <h2>International Users and other countries</h2> <p>Secret participates in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor programs, and it adheres to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
